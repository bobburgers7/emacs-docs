## 13.14.2 Texinfo specific export settings

The Texinfo export backend has several additional keywords for customizing Texinfo output. Setting these keywords works similar to the general options (see [Export Settings](/docs/org/Export-Settings)).

### ‘`SUBTITLE`’

The document subtitle.

### ‘`SUBAUTHOR`’

Additional authors for the document.

### ‘`TEXINFO_FILENAME`’

The Texinfo filename.

### ‘`TEXINFO_CLASS`’

The default document class (`org-texinfo-default-class`), which must be a member of `org-texinfo-classes`.

### ‘`TEXINFO_HEADER`’

Arbitrary lines inserted at the end of the header.

### ‘`TEXINFO_POST_HEADER`’

Arbitrary lines inserted after the end of the header.

### ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY`’

The directory category of the document. Defaults to `Misc`.

### ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_NAME`’

The directory name of the document. This is the short name under which the `m` command will find your manual in the main Info directory. It defaults to the base name of the Texinfo file.

The full form of the Texinfo entry is `* DIRNAME: NODE.` where `NODE` is usually just `(FILENAME)`. Normally this option only provides the `DIRNAME` part, but if you need more control, it can also be the full entry (recognized by the presence of parentheses or a leading \~\* \~).

### ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_DESC`’

The directory description of the document. Defaults to the title of the document.

### ‘`TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE`’

The printed title of the document.
