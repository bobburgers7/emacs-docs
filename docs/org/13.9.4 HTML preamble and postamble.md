## 13.9.4 HTML preamble and postamble

The HTML exporter has delineations for preamble and postamble. The default value for `org-html-preamble` is `t`, which makes the HTML exporter insert the preamble. See the variable `org-html-preamble-format` for the format string.

Set `org-html-preamble` to a string to override the default format string. If set to a function, the HTML exporter expects the function to return a string upon execution. The HTML exporter inserts this string in the preamble. The HTML exporter does not insert a preamble if `org-html-preamble` is set `nil`.

The above also applies to `org-html-postamble` and `org-html-postamble-format`. In addition, `org-html-postamble` can be set to `auto` (its default value), which makes the HTML exporter build a postamble from looking up author’s name, email address, creator’s name, and date.
