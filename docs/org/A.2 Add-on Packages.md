Various authors wrote a large number of add-on packages for Org. Some of these packages used to be part of the ‘`org-mode`’ repository but are now hosted in a separate ‘`org-contrib`’ repository [here](https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib). A Worg page with more information is at: [https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/).
