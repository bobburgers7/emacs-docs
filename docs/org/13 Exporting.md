## 13 Exporting

At some point you might want to print your notes, publish them on the web, or share them with people not using Org. Org can convert and export documents to a variety of other formats while retaining as much structure (see [Document Structure](/docs/org/Document-Structure)) and markup (see [Markup for Rich Contents](/docs/org/Markup-for-Rich-Contents)) as possible.

The libraries responsible for translating Org files to other formats are called *backends*. Org ships with support for the following backends:

*   *ascii* (ASCII format)
*   *beamer* (LaTeX Beamer format)
*   *html* (HTML format)
*   *icalendar* (iCalendar format)
*   *latex* (LaTeX format)
*   *md* (Markdown format)
*   *odt* (OpenDocument Text format)
*   *org* (Org format)
*   *texinfo* (Texinfo format)
*   *man* (Man page format)

Users can install libraries for additional formats from the Emacs packaging system. For easy discovery, these packages have a common naming scheme: `ox-NAME`, where `NAME` is a format. For example, `ox-koma-letter` for *koma-letter* backend. More libraries can be found in the ‘`org-contrib`’ repository (see [Installation](/docs/org/Installation)).

Org only loads backends for the following formats by default: ASCII, HTML, iCalendar, LaTeX, and ODT. Additional backends can be loaded in either of two ways: by configuring the `org-export-backends` variable, or by requiring libraries in the Emacs init file. For example, to load the Markdown backend, add this to your Emacs config:

```lisp
(require 'ox-md)
```
