## 5.2 Extended Use of TODO Keywords

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and DONE. Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways with *TODO keywords* (stored in `org-todo-keywords`). With special setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

Note that *tags* are another way to classify headlines in general and TODO items in particular (see [Tags](/docs/org/Tags)).
