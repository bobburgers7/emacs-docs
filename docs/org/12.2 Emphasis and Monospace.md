You can make words ‘`*bold*`’, ‘`/italic/`’, ‘`_underlined_`’, ‘`=verbatim=`’ and ‘`~code~`’, and, if you must, ‘`+strike-through+`’. Text in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org specific syntax; it is exported verbatim. Org provides a single command as entry point for inserting the marker character.

### `C-c C-x C-f` (`org-emphasize`)

Prompt for a marker character and insert or change an emphasis. If there is an active region, change that region to a new emphasis. If there is no region, just insert the marker characters and position the cursor between them.

To turn off fontification for marked up text, you can set `org-fontify-emphasized-text` to `nil`. To narrow down the list of the fontified markup syntax, you can customize `org-emphasis-alist`[^1].

To hide the emphasis markup characters in your buffers, set `org-hide-emphasis-markers` to `t`.

Sometimes, when marked text also contains the marker character itself, the result may be unsettling. For example,

```lisp
/One may expect this whole sentence to be italicized, but the
following ~user/?variable~ contains =/= character, which effectively
stops emphasis there./
```

You can use zero width space to help Org sorting out the ambiguity. See [Escape Character](/docs/org/Escape-Character) for more details.

[^1]: The markup will still be recognized. Just not highlighted visually in Emacs.
