## 13.9.6 Quoting HTML tags

The HTML export backend transforms ‘`<`’ and ‘`>`’ to ‘`&lt;`’ and ‘`&gt;`’. To include raw HTML code in the Org file so the HTML export backend can insert that HTML code in the output, use this inline syntax: ‘`@@html:...@@`’. For example:

```lisp
@@html:<b>@@bold text@@html:</b>@@
```

For larger raw HTML code blocks, use these HTML export code blocks:

```lisp
#+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
  All lines between these markers are exported literally
#+END_EXPORT
```
