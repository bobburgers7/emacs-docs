Org does not provide any markup for key bindings that corresponds to Texinfo’s `@kbd` and `@key` commands. One way to deal with this is to fall back to code syntax. ‘`~C-x SPC~`’, for example, is transcoded to `@code{C-x SPC}`.

A better approach is to define and use an Org macro named `kbd`. To make that easier the function `org-texinfo-kbd-macro` is provided, which is intended to be used like this:

```lisp
#+macro: kbd (eval (org-texinfo-kbd-macro $1))

Type {{{kbd(C-c SPC)}}}.
```

which becomes

```lisp
Type @kbd{C-c @key{SPC}}.
```
