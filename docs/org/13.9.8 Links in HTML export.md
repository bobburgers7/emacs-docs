## 13.9.8 Links in HTML export

The HTML export backend transforms Org’s internal links (see [Internal Links](/docs/org/Internal-Links)) to equivalent HTML links in the output. The backend similarly handles Org’s automatic links created by radio targets (see [Radio Targets](/docs/org/Radio-Targets)) similarly. For Org links to external files, the backend transforms the links to *relative* paths.

For Org links to other ‘`.org`’ files, the backend automatically changes the file extension to ‘`.html`’ and makes file paths relative. If the ‘`.org`’ files have an equivalent ‘`.html`’ version at the same location, then the converted links should work without any further manual intervention. However, to disable this automatic path translation, set `org-html-link-org-files-as-html` to `nil`. When disabled, the HTML export backend substitutes the ID-based links in the HTML output. For more about linking files when publishing to a directory, see [Publishing links](/docs/org/Publishing-links).

Org files can also have special directives to the HTML export backend. For example, by using ‘`#+ATTR_HTML`’ lines to specify new format attributes to `<a>` or `<img>` tags. This example shows changing the link’s title and style:

```lisp
#+ATTR_HTML: :title The Org mode website :style color:red;
[[https://orgmode.org]]
```
