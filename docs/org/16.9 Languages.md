Code blocks in dozens of languages are supported. See Worg website for [language specific documentation](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html).

By default, only Emacs Lisp is enabled for evaluation. To enable or disable other languages, customize the `org-babel-load-languages` variable either through the Emacs customization interface, or by adding code to the init file as shown next.

In this example, evaluation is disabled for Emacs Lisp, and enabled for R.

```lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . nil)
   (R . t)))
```

Note that this is not the only way to enable a language. Org also enables languages when loaded with `require` statement. For example, the following enables execution of Clojure code blocks:

```lisp
(require 'ob-clojure)
```
