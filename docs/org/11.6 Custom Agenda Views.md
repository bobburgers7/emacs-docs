Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite agenda buffers. Custom agenda commands are accessible through the dispatcher (see [The Agenda Dispatcher](/docs/org/Agenda-Dispatcher)), just like the default commands.

*   [Block agenda](/docs/org/Block-agenda)
*   [Setting options for custom commands](/docs/org/Setting-options)
