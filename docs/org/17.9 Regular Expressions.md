## 17.9 Regular Expressions

Org, as an Emacs mode, makes use of Elisp regular expressions for searching, matching and filtering. Elisp regular expressions have a somewhat different syntax then some common standards. Most notably, alternation is indicated using ‘`\|`’ and matching groups are denoted by ‘`\(...\)`’. For example the string ‘`home\|work`’ matches either ‘`home`’ or ‘`work`’.
