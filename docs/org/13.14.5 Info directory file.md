## 13.14.5 Info directory file

The end result of the Texinfo export process is the creation of an Info file. This Info file’s metadata has variables for category, title, and description: ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY`’, ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_NAME`’, and ‘`TEXINFO_DIR_DESC`’ keywords that establish where in the Info hierarchy the file fits.

Here is an example that writes to the Info directory file:

```lisp
#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
#+TEXINFO_DIR_NAME: Org Mode
#+TEXINFO_DIR_DESC: Outline-based notes management and organizer
```
