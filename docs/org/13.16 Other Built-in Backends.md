Other export backends included with Org are:

*   ‘`ox-man.el`’: Export to a man page.

To activate such backends, either customize `org-export-backends` or load directly with ‘`(require 'ox-man)`’. On successful load, the backend adds new keys in the export dispatcher (see [The Export Dispatcher](/docs/org/The-Export-Dispatcher)).

Follow the comment section of such files, for example, ‘`ox-man.el`’, for usage and configuration details.
