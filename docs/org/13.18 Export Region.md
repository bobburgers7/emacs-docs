## 13.18 Export Region

Some export backends include commands to convert a region of Org formatted text to another format, such as HTML or LaTeX. The conversion replaces the original source. Here are such commands:

### `org-export-region-to-ascii`

Convert the selected region into ASCII.

### `org-export-region-to-utf8`

Convert the selected region into UTF-8.

### `org-export-region-to-html`

Convert the selected region into HTML.

### `org-export-region-to-latex`

Convert the selected region into LaTeX.

### `org-export-region-to-texinfo`

Convert the selected region into Texinfo.

### `org-export-region-to-md`

Convert the selected region into Markdown.

The in-place conversion is particularly handy for quick conversion of tables and lists in non-Org buffers. For example, in an HTML buffer, write a list in Org syntax, select it, and convert it to HTML with `M-x org-html-convert-region-to-html`.
