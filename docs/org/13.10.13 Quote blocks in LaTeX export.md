slug: Quote-blocks-in-LaTeX-export

The LaTeX export backend accepts two attributes for quote blocks: ‘`:environment`’, for an arbitrary quoting environment (the default value is that of `org-latex-default-quote-environment`: `"quote"`) and ‘`:options`’. For example, to choose the environment ‘`quotation`’, included as an alternative to ‘`quote`’ in standard LaTeX classes:

```lisp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment quotation
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
some text...
#+END_QUOTE
```

To choose the ‘`foreigndisplayquote`’ environment, included in the LaTeX package ‘`csquotes`’, with the ‘`german`’ option, use this syntax:

```lisp
#+LATEX_HEADER:\usepackage[autostyle=true]{csquotes}
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment foreigndisplayquote :options {german}
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
some text in German...
#+END_QUOTE
```

which is exported to LaTeX as

```lisp
\begin{foreigndisplayquote}{german}
some text in German...
\end{foreigndisplayquote}
```
