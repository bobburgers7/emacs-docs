When the available LaTeX export customizations are not sufficient to fine-tune the desired output, it is possible to insert any arbitrary LaTeX code (see [Embedded LaTeX](/docs/org/Embedded-LaTeX)). There are three ways to embed such code in the Org file and they all use different quoting syntax.

Inserting in-line quoted with @ symbols:

```lisp
Code embedded in-line @@latex:any arbitrary LaTeX code@@ in a paragraph.
```

Inserting as one or more keyword lines in the Org file:

```lisp
#+LATEX: any arbitrary LaTeX code
```

Inserting as an export block in the Org file, where the backend exports any code between begin and end markers:

```lisp
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  any arbitrary LaTeX code
#+END_EXPORT
```
