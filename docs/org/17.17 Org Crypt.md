Org Crypt encrypts the text of an entry, but not the headline, or properties. Behind the scene, it uses the [Emacs EasyPG Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/epa.html#Top) to encrypt and decrypt files, and EasyPG needs a correct [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/index.html#Top) setup.

Any text below a headline that has a ‘`crypt`’ tag is automatically encrypted when the file is saved. To use a different tag, customize the `org-crypt-tag-matcher` setting.

Here is a suggestion for Org Crypt settings in Emacs init file:

```lisp
(require 'org-crypt)
(org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
(setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("crypt"))

(setq org-crypt-key nil)
;; GPG key to use for encryption.
;; nil means  use symmetric encryption unconditionally.
;; "" means use symmetric encryption unless heading sets CRYPTKEY property.

(setq auto-save-default nil)
;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need to
;; turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.  Otherwise,
;; you'll get an (annoying) message each time you start Org.

;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
;;
;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
```

It’s possible to use different keys for different headings by specifying the respective key as property ‘`CRYPTKEY`’, e.g.:

```lisp
* Totally secret :crypt:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CRYPTKEY: 0x0123456789012345678901234567890123456789
  :END:
```

Note that the ‘`CRYPTKEY`’ property is only effective when `org-crypt-key` is non-`nil`. If `org-crypt-key` is `nil`, Org uses symmetric encryption unconditionally.

Excluding the ‘`crypt`’ tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted text from being encrypted again.
